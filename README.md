This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Tasks

Level 1: Build the Rate my Professor support agent using data stored in Pinecone

Level 2: Implement a feature that allows users to submit links to various professors' pages on Rate My Professor. The data from these web pages should then be automatically scraped and inserted into Pinecone.

Level 3: Implement an advanced search and recommendation system that allows users to query and receive personalized professor recommendations based on input criteria

Level 4: Integrate sentiment analysis and trend tracking to provide insights into changes in professor ratings and review sentiments over time.
